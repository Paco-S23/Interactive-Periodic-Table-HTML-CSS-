# üìö Interactive Periodic Table with HTML & CSS

This is a web project that presents the periodic table of elements in a visual and interactive way. The site consists of a main page with general information and a second page containing the complete periodic table.

## ‚ú® Project Features

* **Informative Main Page:** A home section (`Tp.html`) that introduces the history and key facts about the periodic table.
* **Interactive Periodic Table:** A dedicated page (`Tabla_2.html`) that displays all 118 chemical elements.
* **Color-Coded Classification:** Each element is colored according to its group (alkali metals, halogens, noble gases, etc.), making identification easy.
* **Hover Effect:** When you hover over an element, it scales up to highlight it and make its data easier to read.
* **Detailed Information:** Each cell in the table displays key information for the element, such as its symbol, name, atomic number, atomic mass, and electron configuration.
